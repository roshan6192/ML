0.04,in this video I'm going to explain how
1.48,to train for Pure muscle growth and I'm
3.399,going to lay out five crucial
5.0,bodybuilding principles that must be
6.72,followed to maximize your muscular
8.36,development this video isn't about how
10.04,to get stronger it isn't about how to
11.559,get both bigger and stronger this video
13.799,is about maximizing pure muscle
17.119,gain chapter 1 tension is
21.4,King okay so the first non-negotiable
24.08,principle is that tension is King at
26.519,this point tension is universally
28.199,recognized as the primary factor driving
30.48,muscle growth tension is the force that
32.04,our muscles experience when they stretch
33.879,and contract under load if you think of
35.92,each muscle fiber as a rope in a tug of
37.84,war that stretching and pulling on the
39.879,rope is tension that tension then causes
42.399,a biochemical signaling Cascade that
44.32,ultimately tells the muscle it needs to
46.0,grow bigger so how do we maximize
47.879,tension on a muscle well answering that
50.16,question leads us into the four
51.879,remaining
53.399,principles chapter 2 use bodybuilding
57.519,technique to ensure maximum tension we
60.039,need to perform exercises using a
62.12,specific type of technique that I'm
64.04,calling bodybuilding technique this
66.0,technique is different from powerlifting
67.68,technique and it's different from how
69.24,most people lift I was at an LA Fitness
71.08,Gym the other day and I noticed just how
73.0,few people actually use bodybuilding
74.96,technique almost nobody was taking all
77.08,the boxes the first box is lifting tempo
79.799,for bodybuilding we generally want a
81.4,controlled 2 to 4 second negative if
83.84,you're used to just letting the weight
85.119,free fall this will feel quite slow at
87.079,first but this is important because
88.56,research shows that the lowering phase
90.52,or the Ecentric is very likely more
93.04,important for muscle growth in the
94.56,positive phase or concentric yet for
97.0,whatever reason most people lift as if
99.159,the opposite were true most people just
100.96,try to get the weight up and then forget
103.0,about lowering it back down especially
105.159,as they get tired toward the end of a
106.92,set but this is a mistake because the
108.68,Reps toward the end of a set are the
110.439,most hypertrophic and the negative is
112.64,the most important part of each rep so
115.04,you really want to control and resist
116.799,the negative especially on those last
118.68,few reps new re Arch also indicates that
120.799,for muscle hypertrophy slower Ecentric
123.079,movements should be paired with faster
125.439,concentric movements this means that
127.119,while you want to go nice and slow on
128.52,the negative you should be more forceful
130.56,and explosive on the positive so if I'm
132.92,doing a hack squat I'm thinking control
135.04,control control on the way down and then
137.72,speed as I explode on the way up on
140.28,lateral raises I'm resisting the weight
141.92,on the way down and then driving the
143.56,dumbbells up and out forcefully on the
145.84,positive the same tempo should apply to
147.56,most exercises in your routine next
149.92,bodybuilding technique means using a
151.56,proper range of motion usually this
153.48,means using a full range of motion so
155.28,you get to at least parallel on squat
157.16,type exercises and ideally a bit below
159.28,parallel you bring the dumbbells all the
161.08,way down on presses until you feel a
162.76,nice deep stretch in your pecs and on
164.56,pull-ups you go all the way up and all
166.239,the way down however there is some
167.84,important Nuance here because recently a
169.72,number of Studies have shown that full
171.12,range of motion isn't always better for
173.08,muscle growth partial reps are sometimes
174.84,more effective but only when they're
176.4,done in the stretched aspect of the lift
178.68,in other words the stretch stretched
180.159,part is more hypertrophic than the
182.08,squeezed part so the bottom half of a
184.239,cable curl is more important than the
186.04,top half of a cable curl the bottom half
188.159,of a squat is more important than the
190.2,top half of a squat so you may not
191.92,necessarily always need to use a full
193.599,range of motion but you do need to get
195.28,the muscle sufficiently stretched while
197.04,lifting to maximize hypertrophy so if
199.319,you're not feeling a deep stretch at the
200.76,bottom of the range of motion you should
202.319,try to find that stretch by going a bit
204.239,deeper if going deeper causes you pain
206.159,or serious discomfort you can work on
207.92,any flexibility or Mobility deficit or
210.239,you can find a different exercise that
211.68,allows you to reach that deep stretch
213.319,because it really is that important
215.08,another thing I've been noticing a lot
216.2,at the gym is that most people do quite
218.04,a lot of cheating on their form probably
220.72,too much cheating to maximize muscle
222.4,growth that's because you can move the
223.879,weight without actually applying much
225.439,tension to the Target muscle for example
227.84,if I curl the weight up while leaning
229.799,back and forth I'm shifting tension away
231.92,from the biceps and onto the lower back
234.159,so we want to ensure that the target
235.76,muscle is receiving most of the tension
237.68,which means keeping momentum under
239.28,control
241.519,chapter three
244.599,effort you need to push sets hard and
247.2,unfortunately research consistently
249.0,shows that most people simply don't push
251.04,their sets hard enough to maximize
252.72,muscle growth it's very common to see
254.439,people hitting the gym year after year
256.199,but making no noticeable progress in
258.239,most cases this isn't because they'
259.88,maxed out their natural potential
261.519,instead it's usually because they simply
263.44,aren't pushing their sets close enough
264.84,to failure to stimulate new hypertrophy
267.24,so how hard is hard enough and how
269.28,important is going to failure well since
271.36,I published my last video on this topic
272.96,there's been a bombshell of a new meta
274.479,analysis that is the science-based
276.039,lifting Community buzzing and I need to
277.96,update a few things first I want to
279.759,quickly announce that I just launched my
281.28,new pure bodybuilding program for
282.88,pre-order over on Jeff ner.me
300.0,here's a sneak peek at week one day one
302.16,of the full body version of the program
303.88,we start with three sets of cross body
305.68,lat pull rounds which offer an insane
307.88,stretch on the lats then we do lwi
309.6,incline Smith machine press for the pecs
311.68,Which is less demanding than a freee
313.12,barbell press then it's on to machine
314.88,hip adductions to get the legs nice and
316.52,warmed up for leg press again another
318.52,low impact exercise that we can push
320.44,harder without generating tons of
322.36,fatigue and then we finish with some
324.0,face PS and cable crunches so by
325.88,prioritizing exercises that are less
327.84,costly recoverywise we're a to push them
330.24,much closer to failure without feeling
332.16,completely wrecked anyway you can
333.52,pre-order the full 10we plan at 30% off
335.919,for the pre-sale and I'll put a link to
337.479,that in the description box down below
339.12,so this is the new meta analysis which
340.68,found that as you get closer and closer
342.28,to failure the more muscle growth you
344.24,tend to see and this is their bombshell
346.12,figure that you've probably seen
347.56,floating around online here on the
349.16,x-axis we have reps in reserve so this
351.319,point here at zero would be failure
353.319,where you couldn't do another rep if you
354.72,tried this point would be two rep shy of
356.72,failure this would be 10 rep shy of
358.639,failure all the way down down to 22 rep
360.759,shy of failure which would basically
362.479,just be the easiest set imaginable and
364.319,then here on the y- AIS is muscle growth
366.4,and as you can see from the trend line
367.88,as you get closer and closer to failure
369.759,you see more and more muscle growth in
371.639,fact as you go from two reps in the tank
373.44,to zero reps in the tank muscle growth
375.36,really spikes up so naturally a lot of
377.68,people who endorse high-intensity to
379.4,failure training have been using this
381.12,study to make their case that if you
382.72,want to maximize muscle growth you need
384.56,to push sets all the way to failure and
386.639,I do think they have a pretty good case
387.96,for that training approach with this
389.28,study however what I haven't seen them
391.08,showing is this other brand new meta
393.199,analysis from 2022 which pulled 15
395.88,studies based on slightly different
397.56,inclusion criteria and came to a
399.36,different conclusion quote there is no
401.319,evidence to support that resistance
402.639,training performed to momentary muscular
404.36,failure is superior to non-failure
406.56,resistance training for muscle
407.96,hypertrophy so what's going on here well
410.479,it seems that depending on which
411.72,specific studies you include and how you
413.759,run the statistics you can either come
415.68,away from this body of science thinking
417.479,that going all the way to failure really
419.68,is a lot better for muscle growth or
421.639,that going all the way to failure
422.919,doesn't actually offer a meaningful
424.199,benefit over stopping a few reps shy the
426.52,evidence is conflicting so what should
428.199,we do practically speaking well this is
430.4,my takeaway do two to three sets on most
432.68,exercises and take the last set all the
434.96,way to failure for the first one or two
436.72,sets leave one or two reps in the tank
438.72,if you were to go to failure on all sets
440.919,you'd most likely be very fatigued by
442.68,the last set which means you'd get less
444.36,reps and hit less volume as a result we
446.759,know from other research that volume is
448.36,also important for muscle growth up to a
450.24,point now rather than do a full deep
451.759,dive on training volume I'll just put a
453.36,text summary up here on screen that you
455.12,guys can pause and read for more detail
456.759,on that so leave a few reps in the tank
458.479,for the earlier sets and send it to Hell
460.56,on the last set I also pretty much
462.28,always leave a rep or two in the tank on
463.919,heavy free weight compound exercises
466.199,like squats bench presses and deadlifts
468.4,even on the last set simply because
469.919,going to failure is so
471.199,disproportionately fatiguing that it's
472.84,not worth the risk on these movements
474.68,but that's also part of the reason why
475.879,those exercises aren't emphasized in my
477.599,pure bodybuilding program
480.28,chapter four give your muscles a reason
482.639,to
483.8,grow to build bigger muscles we need to
486.199,give them a good reason to grow if we
488.36,keep doing the exact same thing week
490.08,after week and month after month our
491.8,muscle growth will fairly quickly
493.28,Plateau so to keep things progressing
495.599,you need to apply the progressive
497.319,overload principle where you aim to
499.24,increase some training variable from
501.039,week to week now there are a few main
502.599,ways to apply Progressive overload
504.44,specifically for bodybuilding first you
506.199,can add reps at the same amount of
507.879,weight for example on bicep you could do
510.0,three sets of 10 in week 1 three sets of
511.96,11 in week 2 three sets of 12 in week
514.2,three and then in week four you could
515.8,either go for 13 reps or you could add
517.68,some weight and return back to 10 reps
519.719,and then start adding reps again this
521.399,type of progression is usually better
522.76,for moderate to high rep zones you can
524.8,also add weight at a fixed rep count for
527.04,example on hack squats you could do
528.64,three sets of six reps with three plates
530.6,per side in week one and then add 10
532.68,pounds to each side each week until
534.76,eventually you build up to four plates
536.32,per side for the same three sets of six
538.519,reps this type of progression is usually
540.56,better for lower to moderate rep zones
542.8,eventually you'll have a week where
543.8,you're not able to add weight or reps
545.8,and in this case you should focus on
547.24,improving some aspect of your Technique
549.48,you can try to control the negative
550.68,better use less momentum on the positive
552.64,or improve your range of motion I still
554.48,count this as Progressive overload
555.92,because it increases tension on the
557.68,target muscle as a final option you can
559.48,try to improve your mind muscle
560.88,Connection by really focusing on feeling
563.24,the target muscle working better
564.76,research has shown that the Mind muscle
566.24,connection can increase hypertrophy in
567.959,some cases and well it may not be as
569.76,effective as adding weight or reps or
571.16,improving technique it's still worth
572.839,keeping in mind especially on isolation
575.079,exercises where traditional overloading
576.959,becomes impractical at a certain point
578.68,of strength
580.2,development chapter five choose high
582.88,tension
584.48,exercises because tension is King we
586.72,need to make sure that we're choosing
588.16,exercises that place high levels of
590.04,tension on the target muscles and this
592.399,is where I may lose some of you so I
594.0,want to reiterate that this advice is
595.839,directed at pure hypertrophy training
598.2,not strength training or hybrid training
600.48,and so while it is true that you can
601.76,build a great physique by only using
603.48,barbell exercises like the squat bench
605.6,press and deadlift especially if you
607.04,throw in a pull-up in a freee row this
609.2,approach is probably too basic to
611.32,maximize muscle growth that's for two
613.399,reasons for one there will be smaller
615.48,muscles that go under stimulated if this
617.44,is literally all you do muscles like the
619.399,biceps side delts hamstrings and calves
621.839,won't be getting enough love and
623.36,secondly some of these exercises don't
625.279,have the best stimulus to fatigue ratio
627.64,this is a term coined by Dr Mike isra
629.44,tell and it essentially means exactly
631.2,what it sounds like the stimulus part
632.959,mainly refers to how much tension the
634.68,exercise delivers to the Target muscle
636.72,and the fatigue part refers to how
638.48,fatiguing the exercise is or how hard it
640.8,is to recover from so for example the
642.92,deadlift offers a high stimulus because
645.04,it places a lot of tension on the glutes
646.72,and the spinal Erectors which is great
648.92,but it also carries a very high fatigue
650.88,demand it's really hard to recover from
652.959,which isn't as great from a bodybuilding
654.68,perspective so for Pure hypertrophy we
656.8,want to at least air toward exercises
658.839,that have a High stimulus to fatigue
660.92,ratio now this doesn't mean that any
662.839,exercise that causes fatigue is bad
664.88,fatigue is an inevitable and necessary
666.88,part of training but generally speaking
669.12,if we can pick an exercise that offers
671.079,just as high or higher of a stimulus for
673.76,Less fatigue that's going to be a good
675.8,pick and machine and cable-based
677.24,exercises are some of the best options
679.279,for this they provide massive tension
681.24,for Less fatigue than free weights and
683.279,also tend to be safer to take to failure
685.32,research also shows that contrary to
687.16,popular belief machines are at least as
689.399,effective as free weights in stimulating
691.079,hypertrophy and some evidence suggests
693.0,that they may be superior in some cases
695.12,this shouldn't be super surprising
696.399,because machines and cables tend to have
698.04,fantastic resistance profiles where you
700.32,get this smooth even tension throughout
702.639,the range of motion for example with the
704.519,standard freeway dumbbell curl your
706.12,biceps reach their highest level of
707.72,tension when the elbow is at 90° and
710.16,experience virtually zero tension when
711.959,the bicep is fully stretched at the
713.36,bottom by contrast the face away Bean
715.44,cable curl offers much more continuous
717.639,tension on the biceps throughout the
719.079,ring range of motion including in that
720.68,important stretch position at the bottom
722.639,now I don't want to overstate the
723.92,superiority of machines and cables free
725.959,weights have some advantages too they're
727.56,more accessible they tend to have better
729.079,strength carryover and they may activate
730.959,smaller stabilizers better and I'm still
732.959,a fan of the barbell I love the squat
734.68,bench and deadlift and I think that
736.079,strength can fit neatly into a
737.519,hypertrophy plan if programmed correctly
740.0,but if we're designing a program purely
741.72,dedicated to muscle growth that's a
743.399,recovery wrinkle we don't need to worry
745.0,about plus we already know that having
746.88,some exercise variety and Novelty is
748.8,good for muscle growth and doing the
750.44,same exercises month after month and
752.199,year after year can get stale there are
754.32,a few other things that can impact
755.56,muscle growth but are relatively less
757.36,important your training split is
758.88,essentially just a way of organizing
760.279,your workouts throughout the week and as
762.0,long as it fits your schedule allows you
763.639,to push your sets hard do enough volume
765.72,and recover between workouts it'll work
767.72,just fine full body routines upper lower
769.8,splits push P leg splits and even
771.639,modified body part splits are all
773.56,effective options also rest periods seem
775.8,to matter somewhat for muscle growth
777.36,resting at least 1 minute between sets
779.279,is generally better than resting for
780.72,less than 1 minute so be careful not to
782.519,rush through your workout as it can
784.0,limit your recovery between sets and
785.92,then there are specialized hypertrophy
787.32,techniques like long length perals myor
789.399,reps and drop sets which can all be
791.199,helpful for driving continued progress
793.12,beyond the beginner stage I'm going to
794.76,cover at least five or six of these
796.24,techniques in an upcoming miniseries so
798.12,make sure you're subscribed and have a
799.44,look out for that within the next month
801.12,and again if you're looking for a
802.079,program to Kickstart some new growth I'd
803.76,recommend checking out my pure
804.839,bodybuilding program over on Jeff
808.12,ner.me % off you'll also get the
810.44,hypertrophy handbook sent to you right
812.32,away which covers everything you need to
813.76,know about training for muscle growth
815.279,and you'll get the pure bodybuilding
816.399,nutrition booklet right away so you can
818.04,get your diet on track as well you'll
819.519,also get all three versions of the pure
821.16,bodybuilding program when you pre-order
822.88,so you'll get the push pull legs full
824.44,body and upper lower versions of the
826.279,program after the pre-order week is over
828.24,you'll just select which one version of
829.92,the program you want unless you want to
831.56,buy all three separately each version of
833.279,the program also includes a weak points
835.04,and arm day so you can prioritize
837.04,whatever your individual weak point is
839.12,and I included the dedicated arm workor
840.759,because it's a really fun workout it's a
842.639,great pump and arms are super important
844.399,for bodybuilding this is definitely not
846.0,like any of my other programs and I
847.68,filmed over 200 private exercise demos
850.48,specifically for this program that each
852.519,come with specific coaching cues and

Title:,How To Train For Pure Muscle Growth
